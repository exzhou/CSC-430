CSC 430 Programming Languages

In this course we were assigned a team to implement a new programming language (JILI) using Typed/Racket. The language evolves through the assignment versions and iteratively aqcuires new and more complex features for programmers to utalize. This language was mainly created for learning purposes to better understand decisive features of programming languages and how those nuances can be problematic for programmers or langauage developers.
